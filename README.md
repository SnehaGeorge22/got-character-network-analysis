Title:
📊 Power Dynamics in Game of Thrones: A Network and Sentiment Analysis

Description:
This project explores the evolution of power in Game of Thrones Season 1 by integrating character network analysis, sentiment analysis (VADER), and topic modeling (NNMF). Using cleaned script data from Kaggle, interactions are categorized and visualized as signed networks with conflict-weighted edges. The study leverages centrality metrics and emotional tone in dialogues to track key power shifts between characters like Eddard Stark and Cersei Lannister.

Key Features:

📚 Text Analysis: N-grams, VADER sentiment scoring, and manual sentiment annotation.

🧠 Topic Modeling: NNMF-based topic extraction to identify key narrative themes.

🕸️ Network Analysis: Constructed signed and conflict-based character interaction networks using NetworkX and Gephi.

🧩 Power Insight: Quantified influence using degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality.

📈 Visualization: Plotted networks and sentiment trends to narrate the rise and fall of character power.

Tools & Libraries:
Python, NLTK, VADER, sklearn, NetworkX, Pandas, Gephi, Matplotlib

Use Case:
Can be adapted to analyze power structures in political discourse, film scripts, or historical narratives using computational methods.
